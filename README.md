# R_DNS
A thread safe DNS server written in Rust. The goal was to better understand how DNS servers work and how to write concurrent and memory safe Rust code, so using several online guides and reading about the Dns Protocol, the initial version was made. I then expanded upon it by including an LRU cache.

## Features
1. Can resolve and return DNS queries via cli such as `dig`
2. Uses a LRU (Least Recently Used) caching protocol
3. Keeps an array of Cache Entries, and constantly updates the entries that have expired
4. Stores and loads the cache via `toml` files
5. Thread safe, with a thread that constantly updates the cache entries to ensure none are expried, and a thread that periodically stores the cache
6. Includes full unit tests for all modules such as the `ByteBuffer`, `DnsCache`, and `DnsRecord` (and more ...)

## Example

##### Client View
```
âžœ  ~ dig @127.0.0.1 -p 2053 google.com

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> @127.0.0.1 -p 2053 google.com

##### Starting the Server
To start the server, simple run `cargo run <max_size> <update_interval_ms> <cache_store_interval>` and to unit test run `cargo test`
